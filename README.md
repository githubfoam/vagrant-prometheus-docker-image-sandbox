vagrant destroy -f  vg-prom-04 does not work

>vagrant destroy -f  vg-prom-04
An action 'destroy' was attempted on the machine 'vg-prom-04',
but another process is already executing an action on the machine.
Vagrant locks each machine for access by only one process at a time.
Please wait until the other Vagrant process finishes modifying this
machine, then try again.

If you believe this message is in error, please check the process
listing for any "ruby" or "vagrant" processes and kill them. Then
try again.
